healthcare,part of a multimillion-pound collaborative project involving experts from eight european and asian institutions... spring (socially pertinent robots in gerontological healthcare) is the first research project to be announced by the national robotarium. spring... a four-year project funded by horizon2020... will develop socially assistive robots (sars) with the capacity to perform multi-person interactions and open domain social conversation for the first time in a healthcare setting. the work builds on the success of heriot-watt university-s amazon alexa prize conversational ai system `alana-. the project will focus on supporting elderly patients by carefully coupling scientific findings and user-focussed technological developments to bring social robots into gerontological healthcare. over the past five years... social robots have been introduced into many public spaces ranging from museums and malls to hospitals and retirement homes. the robots have been able to provide both information and entertainment... but the technology has faced challenges. limitations include the fact that both the hardware and supporting software is often designed for reactive... single-user interactions... leading to limited one-on-one conversations. as a result... the robots typically wait for commands or questions based on a limited set of scripted actions. professor oliver lemon... heriot-watt university... explains why spring is different. he said: research shows that the careful use of robots in group settings can have a positive impact on health... such as decreased stress and loneliness... and improved mood and sociability. healthcare practitioners have been supportive of the use of robots during the non-medical phases of time in hospital because social robots can help explain complex concepts to patients with limited medical knowledge. social robot technology is of interest for elder care because robot companionship has the long-term potential to better connect people with each other. social robots could improve both psychological well-being and the relationship between patients and hospital professionals. while overcoming the limitations of current social robots raises numerous scientific and technological challenges... it has the potential to create tremendous social impact and economic value. the national robotarium-s focus on creating societal benefits is ideally aligned to addressing such challenges. this type of technology is touch-free and hands-free so will be in great demand in the future as it will reduce the risk and spread of infection. spring will develop new research into conversational ai... computer vision... machine learning and human-robot interaction... alongside human behaviour analysis and sensorimotor robot control. the work will focus on helping social robots to understand various individuals and group situations and take appropriate decisions such as identifying patients that have been waiting alone for a long time or who might be anxious. the social robots willultimately engage in face-to-face conversation with patients... their family members... staff members... and with whole groups of people.
manufacturing,-1.3m project investigates if robots can be used to build lasers. experts at the new national robotarium in edinburgh and their industrial partners have launched a -1.3 million project to work out if robots could be used to help humans build lasers. manufacturing lasers is a lengthy and delicate process... with individual components aligned step-by-step as each device is assembled. currently... the process requires dedicated manufacturing lines... which makes it difficult and expensive for the companies that produce lasers to respond quickly to changes in demand from their markets. the new three-year project... funded by the ukri engineering and physical sciences research council (epsrc)... aims to discover if robots could be used to carry out some of the most repetitive and time-consuming assembly and alignment steps in the manufacturing process... which would then free up humans to concentrate on the important testing and quality-control steps. announcement of the groundbreaking research project comes as the national robotarium officially opened the doors to its new state-of-art -22.4 million facility in edinburgh on 28th september... 2022. utilising expertise from both heriot-watt university and the university of edinburgh... it is the most advanced centre for robotics and ai in the uk and houses extensive world-class facilities for researchers and businesses. lasers will play an important role in the newly opened facility - the site has a dedicated laser laboratory... and its projects include developing robots that will use the devices across a wide range of applications... from remote sensing for agriculture through to diagnosis and treatment in medicine. researchers from the national robotarium will be joined in their laser project by industrial experts from optical components manufacturer gooch & housego... aerospace giant leonardo and laser maker luxinar. the national robotarium is part of the data-driven innovation initiative... supported by -21 million from the uk government and -1.4 million from the scottish government. the initiative aims to turn edinburgh into the data capital of europe and is part of the wider -1.3 billion edinburgh and south-east scotland city region deal. project leader and ultra lab lead at the national robotarium... dr richard carter... said: this project will push our understanding of robots- capabilities to the limit. no one knows if robots will be capable of carrying out such complex and intuitive tasks... and so we-ll be working with experienced personnel from throughout the industry to find out. making lasers is a delicate and highly skilled job... with many repetitive steps to make sure each component is aligned as it-s assembled into the device. if we can design robots that can carry out many of those repetitive steps then we will be able to improve the quality of the jobs for the talented experts who make these lasers and free them up to work on the important testing and quality assurance steps in the process. dr carter added: one of the activities we-ll undertake during this project is to film experts assembling lasers and then ask them questions about what they do at each step. so much of the manufacturing process is down to human intuition and experience... and it-s really difficult to teach those factors to a machine. if we can develop robots and control systems that can carry out these tasks then the results will have applications in other fields too.
offshore,rov windfarm inspection gets global coverage. researchers from the national robotarium... a world-leading centre for robotics and artificial intelligence who are working with businesses to develop valuable solutions to industry challenges... helped edf deploy a uniquely customised remotely operated vehicle (rov) to carry out what is believed to be the first autonomous wind farm foundation inspection at its blyth offshore wind farm. the rov... equipped and operated by researchers from the orca hub... a strategic project within the national robotarium... was modified to include cutting-edge robotic technologies for autonomous inspection capabilities and carried out visual inspections of the gravity-based foundations of three offshore turbines over the course of four days. the inspections were undertaken as part of a partnership between edf and the orca hub to investigate a wide range of potential applications for drone technology to assess offshore wind turbines. the trials demonstrated the drones ability to work autonomously at the site... as it recorded videos to assess the exterior condition of turbine foundations and cables. the drone was also used to create a 3d reconstruction model of parts of the underwater assets... which will be used to monitor biofouling... the accumulation of microorganisms... plants and algae on the turbine foundations. maxime duchet... offshore wind research engineer at edf r&d uk centre... said: these trials have showcased the ability of autonomous inspection drones to collect high-quality images off offshore turbine technology. these images... and the modelling they enable... will greatly enhance our ability to carry out operations and maintenance activities on-site. further tests are needed to estimate the time required to inspect all of the turbine foundations... and to demonstrate the full potential of marine robotic technology. however it is clear from these initial results that the technology can ensure safer and faster operations and a reduced carbon footprint. dr sen wang... former lead of robotics and autonomous systems at the national robotarium... said: this trial demonstrates the enormous potential for underwater robots to autonomously carry out inspection and maintenance of offshore wind turbines... reducing the need and the associated risks of putting personnel into challenging and hazardous environments. by equipping the rov with sensors and robot autonomy software developed by the orca hub... we can obtain high-quality videos and build an extremely accurate 3d model of the turbine foundations... providing rich information in a more efficient manner for companies working in this sector. due to their locations... offshore wind farms are costly and difficult to monitor and maintain with the industry currently facing a range of challenges such as cost... safety and operational logistics. the orca hub can help its partners to overcome many of these challenges. we are already demonstrating the many benefits of using robotics in the offshore renewable sector... giving service providers and operators... like edf... a wealth of information and data to support their planning... maintenance and decision-making while reducing costs... risks and carbon footprint.
