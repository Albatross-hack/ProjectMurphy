    "Agriculture" to DescMake(
        "Tackling food security ... Dr Fernando Auat Cheein, Associate Professor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems ... Early “robots” in agriculture were actually automated harvesting machines. We’ve added intelligence and decision-making capability and now robots harvest, plant, seed, prune, do herbicide management, monitor and observe the characteristics of crops – all the main tasks ... Connecting those robots into the cloud means the robot gets information from sensors and allows farmers to make future decisions based on real-life data. For example, you can distinguish between what should be harvested and what should be left in the field – and estimate the amount of harvest before picking to plan better and reduce costs.Robots are not replacing people in agriculture – there aren’t enough humans to do the work and that is becoming a greater problem. Globally, younger generations don’t want to work in the fields. It’s better to start doing things with robots now than wait until we don’t have a human labour force. Robots can also do tasks humans shouldn’t do, like carrying 20kg of fruit on your back.You also have environmental benefits as robots are largely electrically controlled, rather than using combustion engines.One challenge is that agriculture can be resistant to change and wants clear evidence that technology works. If it doesn’t work, you have to wait until the next year, and try something different.Another challenge is that different fruits and vegetables need different solutions in different countries. If we design a robot that works in Scotland it might not work well in Brazil or Australia, where the weather, soil and humidity are different. We need technology to help countries where there isn’t enough water, for example, to spread herbicides efficiently so they are not damaging soils, and to monitor all the different indicators.Ultimately, it’s about using robotics, AI and data to make agriculture more efficient and deliver larger, better quality and more predictable crops. The world’s population is growing and we need more food. In Europe, we’re taking this into vertical farming, where the inputs are controlled in an industrial process. That’s developing all the time, but there is still so much robotics can do for traditional field agriculture.",

Team EMMA (Embodied MultiModal Agent), led by PhD students Amit, Hementhage, Malvina, and Georgios, successfully completed the Public Benchmark Challenge in April. The challenge involved talking a robot model through a series of household tasks using predefined dialogue datasets – created and provided by Amazon – to assess its ability to follow instructions, learn, and predict changes in its 3D virtual environment. Team EMMA, the only non-US team to be shortlisted for the competition, placed sixth on the leader board, allowing them to continue into the ‘live interactions’ development phase, beginning in July 2022. During this phase, the teams will compete to develop a bot that best responds to real Alexa customers who will rate, review and feedback in real-time. The outcome of the development phase will be revealed during the finals, scheduled for early 2023. Professor Verena Rieser, Professor of Conversational AI at the National Robotarium, and team advisor said: 'The Alexa Prize SimBot Challenge is focused on helping advance the next generation of virtual assistants that will assist humans in completing real-world tasks.'The technology and research being developed by the teams involved is really exciting as it could ultimately mean that robots are able to help and support people in their homes and other real-life environments.",
